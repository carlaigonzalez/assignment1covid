Assignment 1: Data collection and curation. Analyze of collection of data from surveys of COVID19 vaccination.
My goal for this assignment was to construct data, which was collected from surveys on googleforms, I sent it to friends, family and asked them to pass it through. Another goal was to learn to program, which I totally did! My skillsin python are defintely better comparing to some weeks ago. Finally, to learn important trends from this COVID-19 vaccine surveys. 
The only bias I can think of, is that mostly it is young students.
